# Guidelines for Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the resources
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new resources

## Review Our [Code of Conduct]()
All contributors are expected to follow the code of conduct when contributing to or discussing this project.

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host resources, to track issues, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the resources (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report issues using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs and requests. Report an issue by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write issues with detail and background
It is important that this project be as correct and useful as possible. Therefore, if you see and error or see something you'd like to have added, please share it!

**Great Issue Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- What you believe a resource _should_ say or be
- What is actually present
- Scriptural support/sources cited (when necessary)
- Notes (anything else you think is relevant to the discussion of your issue.)

People *love* thorough issue reports. I'm not even kidding.
